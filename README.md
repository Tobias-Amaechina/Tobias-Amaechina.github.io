## Built With
* **HTML5:** Utilized semantic elements and a  range of heading tags (H1-H3) for structured content and Paragraph tags as well.

1. Using the correct **heading levels** to ensure the page is accessible.
2. Writing clean, readable CSS.
3. Organizing a static site without external libraries.
